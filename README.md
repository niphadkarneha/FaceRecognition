# [Face Recognition](https://www.nehaniphadkar.in/FacialRecognitionWithCode/facerecognition/)

This tutorial uses Python and related libraries [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to detect a face in an image or group of images.

## Part 1 : Detecting 1 Person Amongst Many

First image used to train

![Known image of Me(Neha)](./profile.jpg)

Face detected amongst many
![Face Recognized using Python and Face_Recognition Library](./result.jpg)


Second image used to train along with first one

![Known image of Dr. Ravi Mukkamal](./ravi.png)

Faces detected amongst many
![Face Recognized using Python and Face_Recognition Library](./result_neha_ravim.jpg)

In the above image, only Dr. Ravi Mukkamala's face and my face has our names under them, all other faces are labelled as unknown. You can run the attached notebook in either Anaconda or Google Colab and try the codes for yourself. All the necessary libraries to run it successfully are mentioned in the notebook.

Happy Learning ðŸ“œ
